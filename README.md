# Responsible

OpenAPI toolkit

## Responsible in 15 minutes

## Why

### Custom DSL

- OpenAPI DSL is extremely verbose and hard to read. It's also hard to maintain. This library provides a custom DSL that
  is much more readable and maintainable.

## CLI

```shell
brew tap responsibleapi/responsible
brew install responsible
responsible 
```
